.SH NAME
TICCL-rank - a ranker for word variant pairs delivered by TICCL-LDcalc

.SH SYNOPSIS

TICCL-rank [options] FILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B TICCL-rank
reads a file of word variant pairs (typicaly generated by
.B TICCL-LDcalc
) and ranks them according to a lot of criteria.
The output file will give, for each word from the input, a descending list of at
most 'clip' variants, sorted in descending order of confidence. The confidence score is derived from the ranking features.

.SH OPTIONS

.B FILE
.RS
is an inputfile in
.B TICCL-LDcalc
format
.RE

.B --alph
alphabetfile
.RS
an alphabet in
.B TICCL-lexstat
format
.RE

.B --charconf
confusfile
.RS
a lexstat character confusion file as produced by
.B TICCL-lexstat
.RE

.B -o
outfile
.RS
store the results in
.B outfile
.RE

.B --charconfreq
filename
.RS
optionally output a frequency list of all character confusions found in
.B infile
.RE

.B --debug
debugfile
.RS
create a parallel outputfile containing ALL information on which the ranking is
based.
.RE

.B --clip
clip
.RS
output at most 'clip' variants per word. Clip to 1 to obtain only the first-best ranked correction candidates 
(as required for fully automatic spelling or OCR/HTR variant (post-)correction. 
.RE

.B --subtractartifrqfeature1
artif
.RS
Decrease the frequencies for feature 1 with value 'artifreq'. The same value
should have been used by
.B
TICCL-LDcalc
.RE

.B --subtractartifrqfeature2
artif
.RS
Decrease the frequencies for feature 2 with value 'artifreq'. The same value
should have been used by
.B
TICCL-LDcalc
.RE

.B --artifreq
artifreq
.RS
Decrease the frequencies with value 'artifreq'. The same value should have been
used by
.B
TICCL-LDcalc.
OBSOLETE: use
.B --subtractartifrqfeature2 instead
.RE

.B --wordvec
wordvectorfile
.RS
read a Google word2vec file to calculate cosine ranking and use that as a ranking feature (Experimental. Very slow!).
.RE

.B --skipcols
valuelist
.RS
skip the named columns from the
.B input
file in the ranking process.

example:
.B --skipcols=3,6
the columns 3 and 6 are not used in the ranking
.RE

.B -t
or
.B --threads
num_threads
.RS
use 'num_threads' threads to run on. You may us --threads="max" to use as many
threads as possible. This will allocate 2 processors less than given by the
$OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, leaving some processor power for other
purposes.
.RE

.B -h or
.B --help
.RS
show usage()
.RE

.B -v
.RS
show debug information
.RE

.B -V or
.B --version
.RS
Show VERSION
