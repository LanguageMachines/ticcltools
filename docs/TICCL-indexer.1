.TH TICCL-indexer 1 "2020 mar 09"

.SH NAME
TICCL-indexer - a tool to create an exhaustive index to all lexical variant pairs
given a particular Levenshtein or edit distance in a corpus or the corpus focus list.

.SH SYNOPSIS

TICCL-indexer [options]

TICCL-indexerNT [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B TICCL-indexer
and
.B TICCL-indexerNT
both process an anagram file (as generated by
.B TICCL-anahash
) and a character confusion file (as generated by
.B FoLiA-lexstat
) and create a possibly very large file of character confusion anagram values
chained to the lower word anagram values for word pairs displaying the
particular character confusion.

.B TICCL-indexer
is recommended for large corpora, i.e. when you have more items in the corpus
frequency list than you have in the character confusion file. It can run on multiple threads, at
the cost of a higher memory usage.

.B TICCL-indexerNT
is recommended for relatively small corpora. It can run on multiple threads, at
the cost of a higher memory usage.

.SH OPTIONS
.B --hash
anagramfile
.RS
the file generated by
.B TICCL-anahash
.
.RE

.B --charconf
character confusionfile
.RS
the character confusion file generated by
.B TICCL-lexstat
.
.RE

.B --foci
focifile
.RS
Use 'focifile' to select only the anagram hash values actually observed in the corpus itself 
with a frequency lower than the artifrq to work on. This file is generated by
.B TICCL-anahash
when the
.B --artifrq
option is used. This limits the overall search space and the amount of work to be done.
.RE

.B -o
outputfile
.RS
the name of the output file. Whatever you choose here, the extension will be set
to '.index' for
.B TICCL-indexer
and to '.indexNT' for
.B TICCL-indexerNT
.RE

.B --confstats
statsfile
.RS
Use 'statsfile' to create a separate list of observed confusion statistics. (optional)
.RE


.B --low
low
.RS
let the program exclude entries from the anagram file that are shorter than 'low' characters.
The default is 5.
.RE

.B --high
high
.RS
let the program exclude entries from the anagram file that are longer than 'high' characters.
The default is 35.
.RE

.B -t
or
.B --threads
num_threads
.RS
use 'num_threads' threads to run on. You may us --threads="max" to use as many
threads as possible. This will allocate 2 processors less than given by the
$OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable, leaving some processor power for other
purposes.
.RE

.B -v
.RS
be more verbose.
