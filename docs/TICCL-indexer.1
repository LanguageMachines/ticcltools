.SH NAME
TICCL-indexer - a tool to create an exhaustive index to all lexical variants
given a particular Levenshtein or edit distance in a corpus.

.SH SYNOPSIS

TICCL-indexer [options]

TICCL-indexerNT [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B TICCL-indexer
and
.B TICCL-indexerNT
both proces an anagram file (as generated by
.B TICCL-anahash
) and a character confusion file (as generated by
.B FoLiA-lexstat
) and create a possibly very large file of character confusion anagram values
chained to the lower word anagram values for word pairs displaying the
particular character confusion.

.B TICCL-indexer
is recommended for large corpora, i.e. when you have more items in the corpus
frequency list than you have in the character confusion file.

.B TICCL-indexerNT
is recommended for relatively small corpora. It can run on multiple threads, at
the cost of a higher memory usage.
