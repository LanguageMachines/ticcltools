.SH NAME
TICCL-lexstat \- an alphabet file and character confusion file generator

.SH SYNOPSIS

TICCL-lexstat [options] FILE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B TICCL-lexstat
Step 1: reads a language specific lexicon and creates an alphabet file based on character frequencies. Step 2: reads an alphabet file ( previously generated by
.B TICCL-lexstat
) and creates first a file with a frequency list of all character
values, then - after 'clipping' beneath a particular character frequency: a list of anagram hash values for all character confusion pairs up to the specified 'LD'

Character frequencies lower than 'clip' (option \-\-clip) are then skipped,

.SH OPTIONS
.B \-\-clip
clip
.RS
skip characters less frequent than 'clip'
.RE
.B \-\-LD
depth
.RS
Generate confusions up to a Levenshtein distance of 'depth' (default 2)

When LD=0, only a character frequency file is produced. This is the necessary first pass.
.RE

.B \-\-all
.RS
Output all different character confusion sequences for each character confusion anagram value. Default only the first one is shown.
.RE

.B \-\-diac
.RS
Output an extra file with confusions for diacritics
shown.
.RE

.B \-\-separator
sep
.RS
add 'sep' as a character to the character list. This is required for word bigrams or trigrams and replaces the 'space' character.
.RE

.B \-o
outfile
.RS
Base the output file name(s) on 'outfile'. Default the name of the inputfile is used. Use this also when the directory of the inputfile is read\-only
.RE

.B \-v
or
.B \-\-verbose
.RS
