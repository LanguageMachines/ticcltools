ticcltools 0.6 2018-06-05
[Ko vander Sloot]
Intermediate release, with a lot of new code to handle N-grams
Also a lot of refactoring is done, for more clear and maintainable code.
This is work in progress still.

* TICCL-unk:
  - more extensive acronym detection
  - fixed artifreq problems in 'clean' punctuated words
  - added filters for 'unwanted' characters
  - added a ligature filter to convert evil ligatures
  - normalize all hyphens to a 'normal' one (-)
  - use a better definition of punctuation (unicode character class is not
    good enough to decide)

* TICCL-lexstat:
  - the 'separator' symbol should get freq=0, so it isn't counted
  - the clip value is added to the output filename

* TICCL-indexer:
  - indexer and indexerNT now produce the same output, using different
    strategies when a --foci files is used.

* TICCL-LDcalc:
  major overhaul for n-grams
  - added a ngram point column to the output (so NOT backward compatible!)
  - produce a '.short' list for short word corrections
  - produce a '.ambi' file with a list of n-grams related to short words
  - prune a lot of ngrams from the output

* TICCL-rank:
 - output is sorted now
 - honor the ngram-points from the new LDcalc. (so NOT backward compatible!)

* TICCL-chain: new module to chain ranked files

* TICCL-lexclean:
  -added a -x option for 'inverse' alphabet

* TICCL-anahash:
  - added a --list option to produce a list of words and anagram values
